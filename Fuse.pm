=head1 NAME

Fuse - write filesystems in Perl using FUSE

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Fuse;
  my ($mountpoint) = "";
  $mountpoint = shift(@ARGV) if @ARGV;
  Fuse::main(mountpoint=>$mountpoint, getattr=>"main::my_getattr", getdir=>"main::my_getdir", ...);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This lets you implement filesystems in perl, through the FUSE
(Filesystem in USErspace) kernel/lib interface.

FUSE expects you to implement callbacks for the various functions.

In the following definitions, "errno" can be 0 (for a success),
-EINVAL, -ENOENT, -EONFIRE, any integer less than 1 really.

You can import standard error constants by saying something like
"use POSIX qw(EDOTDOT ENOANO);".

Every constant you need (file types, open() flags, error values,
etc) can be imported either from POSIX or from Fcntl, often both.
See their respective documentations, for more information.

=head2 EXPORTED SYMBOLS

None by default.

You can request all exportable symbols by using the tag ":all".

You can request the extended attribute symbols by using the tag ":xattr".
This will export XATTR_CREATE and XATTR_REPLACE.

=head2 FUNCTIONS

=head3 Fuse::main

Takes arguments in the form of hash key=>value pairs.  There are
many valid keys.  Most of them correspond with names of callback
functions, as described in section 'FUNCTIONS YOUR FILESYSTEM MAY IMPLEMENT'.
A few special keys also exist:


debug => boolean

=over 1

This turns FUSE call tracing on and off.  Default is 0 (which means off).

=back

mountpoint => string

=over 1

The point at which to mount this filesystem.  There is no default, you must
specify this.  An example would be '/mnt'.

=back

mountopts => string

=over 1

This is a comma seperated list of mount options to pass to the FUSE kernel
module.

At present, it allows the specification of the allow_other
argument when mounting the new FUSE filesystem. To use this, you will also
need 'user_allow_other' in /etc/fuse.conf as per the FUSE documention

  mountopts => "allow_other" or
  mountopts => ""

=back

threaded => boolean

=over 1

This turns FUSE multithreading on and off.  The default is 0, meaning your FUSE
script will run in single-threaded mode.  Note that single-threaded mode also
means that you will not have to worry about reentrancy, though you will have to
worry about recursive lookups.  In single-threaded mode, FUSE holds a global
lock on your filesystem, and will wait for one callback to return before
calling another.  This can lead to deadlocks, if your script makes any attempt
to access files or directories in the filesystem it is providing.  (This
includes calling stat() on the mount-point, statfs() calls from the 'df'
command, and so on and so forth.)  It is worth paying a little attention and
being careful about this.

Enabling multithreading will cause FUSE to make multiple simultaneous calls
into the various callback functions of your perl script.  If you enable 
threaded mode, you can enjoy all the parallel execution and interactive
response benefits of threads, and you get to enjoy all the benefits of race
conditions and locking bugs, too.  Please also ensure any other perl modules
you're using are also thread-safe.

(If enabled, this option will cause a warning if your perl interpreter was not
built with USE_ITHREADS, or if you have failed to use threads or
threads::shared.)

=head2 FUNCTIONS YOUR FILESYSTEM MAY IMPLEMENT

=head3 getattr

Arguments:  filename.
Returns a list, very similar to the 'stat' function (see
perlfunc).  On error, simply return a single numeric scalar
value (e.g. "return -ENOENT();").

FIXME: the "ino" field is currently ignored.  I tried setting it to 0
in an example script, which consistently caused segfaults.

Fields (the following was stolen from perlfunc(1) with apologies):

($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid,$rdev,$size,
        $atime,$mtime,$ctime,$blksize,$blocks)
                         = getattr($filename);

Here are the meaning of the fields:

 0 dev      device number of filesystem
 1 ino      inode number
 2 mode     file mode  (type and permissions)
 3 nlink    number of (hard) links to the file
 4 uid      numeric user ID of file's owner
 5 gid      numeric group ID of file's owner
 6 rdev     the device identifier (special files only)
 7 size     total size of file, in bytes
 8 atime    last access time in seconds since the epoch
 9 mtime    last modify time in seconds since the epoch
10 ctime    inode change time (NOT creation time!) in seconds
            since the epoch
11 blksize  preferred block size for file system I/O
12 blocks   actual number of blocks allocated

(The epoch was at 00:00 January 1, 1970 GMT.)

=head3 readlink

Arguments:  link pathname.
Returns a scalar: either a numeric constant, or a text string.

This is called when dereferencing symbolic links, to learn the target.

example rv: return "/proc/self/fd/stdin";

=head3 getdir

Arguments:  Containing directory name.
Returns a list: 0 or more text strings (the filenames), followed by a numeric errno (usually 0).

This is used to obtain directory listings.  Its opendir(), readdir(), filldir() and closedir() all in one call.

example rv: return ('.', 'a', 'b', 0);

=head3 mknod

Arguments:  Filename, numeric modes, numeric device
Returns an errno (0 upon success, as usual).

This function is called for all non-directory, non-symlink nodes,
not just devices.

=head3 mkdir

Arguments:  New directory pathname, numeric modes.
Returns an errno.

Called to create a directory.

=head3 unlink

Arguments:  Filename.
Returns an errno.

Called to remove a file, device, or symlink.

=head3 rmdir

Arguments:  Pathname.
Returns an errno.

Called to remove a directory.

=head3 symlink

Arguments:  Existing filename, symlink name.
Returns an errno.

Called to create a symbolic link.

=head3 rename

Arguments:  old filename, new filename.
Returns an errno.

Called to rename a file, and/or move a file from one directory to another.

=head3 link

Arguments:  Existing filename, hardlink name.
Returns an errno.

Called to create hard links.

=head3 chmod

Arguments:  Pathname, numeric modes.
Returns an errno.

Called to change permissions on a file/directory/device/symlink.

=head3 chown

Arguments:  Pathname, numeric uid, numeric gid.
Returns an errno.

Called to change ownership of a file/directory/device/symlink.

=head3 truncate

Arguments:  Pathname, numeric offset.
Returns an errno.

Called to truncate a file, at the given offset.

=head3 utime

Arguments:  Pathname, numeric actime, numeric modtime.
Returns an errno.

Called to change access/modification times for a file/directory/device/symlink.

=head3 open

Arguments:  Pathname, numeric flags (which is an OR-ing of stuff like O_RDONLY
and O_SYNC, constants you can import from POSIX).
Returns an errno.

No creation, or trunctation flags (O_CREAT, O_EXCL, O_TRUNC) will be passed to open().
Your open() method needs only check if the operation is permitted for the given flags, and return 0 for success.

=head3 read

Arguments:  Pathname, numeric requestedsize, numeric offset.
Returns a numeric errno, or a string scalar with up to $requestedsize bytes of data.

Called in an attempt to fetch a portion of the file.

=head3 write

Arguments:  Pathname, scalar buffer, numeric offset.  You can use length($buffer) to
find the buffersize.
Returns an errno.

Called in an attempt to write (or overwrite) a portion of the file.  Be prepared because $buffer could contain random binary data with NULLs and all sorts of other wonderful stuff.

=head3 statfs

Arguments:  none
Returns any of the following:

-ENOANO()

or

$namelen, $files, $files_free, $blocks, $blocks_avail, $blocksize

or

-ENOANO(), $namelen, $files, $files_free, $blocks, $blocks_avail, $blocksize

=head3 flush

Arguments: Pathname
Returns an errno or 0 on success.

Called to synchronise any cached data. This is called before the file
is closed. It may be called multiple times before a file is closed.

=head3 release

Arguments: Pathname, numeric flags passed to open
Returns an errno or 0 on success.

Called to indicate that there are no more references to the file. Called once
for every file with the same pathname and flags as were passed to open.

=head3 fsync

Arguments: Pathname, numeric flags
Returns an errno or 0 on success.

Called to synchronise the file's contents. If flags is non-zero,
only synchronise the user data. Otherwise synchronise the user and meta data.

=head3 setxattr

Arguments: Pathname, extended attribute's name, extended attribute's value, numeric flags (which is an OR-ing of XATTR_CREATE and XATTR_REPLACE 
Returns an errno or 0 on success.

Called to set the value of the named extended attribute.

If you wish to reject setting of a particular form of extended attribute name
(e.g.: regexps matching user\..* or security\..*), then return - EOPNOTSUPP.

If flags is set to XATTR_CREATE and the extended attribute already exists,
this should fail with - EEXIST. If flags is set to XATTR_REPLACE
and the extended attribute doesn't exist, this should fail with - ENOATTR.

XATTR_CREATE and XATTR_REPLACE are provided by this module, but not exported
by default. To import them:

    use Fuse ':xattr';

or:

    use Fuse ':all';

=head3 getxattr

Arguments: Pathname, extended attribute's name
Returns an errno, 0 if there was no value, or the extended attribute's value.

Called to get the value of the named extended attribute.

=head3 listxattr

Arguments: Pathname
Returns a list: 0 or more text strings (the extended attribute names), followed by a numeric errno (usually 0).

=head3 removexattr

Arguments: Pathname, extended attribute's name
Returns an errno or 0 on success.
